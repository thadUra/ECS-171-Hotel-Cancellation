#### Abstract

For most people who travel or go on vacation, one of the most essential aspects of a trip is: where will I end up staying the night? For that reason, the hotel business has become one of the most competitive within the hospitality industry as companies fight amongst each other for the most bookings. On average the percentage of cancellations across reservations are a staggering 24%. Therefore, hotel companies need to learn about the habits, patterns, and tendencies of their customers in order to look as appealing as possible to gain positive local reputations. Using data from the article “Hotel Booking Demand Datasets,” provided by Kaggle, we can determine certain relationships between hotel bookings and cancellations to possibly gain more insight as to why people may back out of a reservation. In our project, we hope to help hotels determine what factors are most impactful for predicting whether a hotel reservation will be canceled. We will utilize various data visualization tools and algorithms for finding the correlation between certain independent features in the data set and prediction models to quantify a specific relationship between those variables for predicting future cancellations.

#### Data Description

The dataset contains booking information for city hotels and resort hotels such as if the reservation was cancelled, booking dates, length of stay, number of adults and children, parking spaces, and other miscellaneous factors.
